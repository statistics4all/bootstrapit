Open Source API for bootstrapping your data
</p>


Let's be honest, most of us have concerns using statistical methods, because we do not 
understand what we are doing in the magic land of statistics. We do not know how to treat our data right
and frankly speaking, universities do not a good job teaching us to treat our data right. We all had 
statistical courses, but handling acutal data in the real world of science and engineering is a totally different
ball game. This is why we feel uncomfortable using the methods we learned in statistics, we do not know when it is appropriate to use which method and why is we always think about the normal distribution?

Thats why we started this open source software project BootstrapIt, paired with a scientifc paper explaining the used mechanismes based on a solid mathematical background. And straight at the beginning we are honest with you. We do not give you a magical wand which solves every statistical problem you have and uses rainbows to do so. What we do is give you the computation power of modern computers to do statistics, which was not possible when the most statistical methods were invented. Even the method we use is not new, but not a lot of scientists and engineers use it in there day to day life because the text books don't.
