# Step 1: import the bootstrapit module file
"""
This is the typical python import function. In order to use the functionality
of the bootstrapit module, we have to import it. This is because the module 
functions are written in the seperate file called "bootstrapit.py".
"""
from bootstrapit import *

# Step 2: Start a new analysis 
"""
A new analysis is started by calling Bootstrapit with the input data file. 
Bootstrapit can handle csv, xls, and xlsx file at the moment. Please organise
your data row, or column wise with the data title in the first entry.
See the example files: input_row_ordered.xls and input_column_ordered.xls for 
an example data organisation.

When your input file is in the same folder as the bootstrapit files then you
can just use the filename with the filetype extension --> filename.filetype 
(e.g. input.xls). If you store your data in a complete different folder then 
please enter the full file_path. This way bootstrapit can import your data 
correctly.
